    **What is Binance Smart Chain?**


    Binance Smart Chain or BSC is&nbsp;**a smart contract platform launched by Binance based on the Go Ethereum (Geth) client **making it compatible with blockchain apps developed for the Ethereum network.


    The Binance Smart Chain uses BEP20 as a standard for crypto tokens on its platform. BEP20 is the same as [ERC20 on Ethereum Network](https://metaschool.so/articles/erc-20-token/).&nbsp;
